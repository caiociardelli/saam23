# LAB
-----------------------

This directory contains both the original LAB file and a masked version in GRD format (GMT grid file). The masked version, in addition to excluding regions with insufficient resolution (where LAB estimates are unreliable), has been interpolated to a higher resolution. We recommend using the masked version unless you have a specific reason to work with the original.
